## L01 Basics of Information
Information is data that helps to know about particular fact by reducing uncertainty.
Choose a variable $x_{i}$ with associated probability $p_{i}$, then **quantified information** is defined by  Shannon as:
$$I(x_{i})=log_{2}(\frac{1}{p_{i}}) \text{  [in bits]}$$
Uncertainty is inversely proportional to probability.

*Example:*  
From 52 cards randomly draw 1, what is the color of the card?  
- if told that the drawn card is heart, then information equals to
$$I(\text{heart}) = log_{2}(\frac{1}{^{13}/_{52}}) = 2  \text{ bits}$$
- if told that the drawn card is not the Ace of Spades, then information equals to
$$I(\text{!Ace of Spades}) = log_{2}(\frac{1}{^{51}/_{52}}) = 0.028  \text{ bits}$$
Therefore, being told that the drawn card is heart, we get more information (less uncertainty) of the card than being told that it is not the Ace of Spades.

**Entropy** is defined as average bits of information containd in each variable set X:
$$H(X)= E(I(X))=\sum p_{i} log_{2}(\frac{1}{p_{i}}) $$
Entropy is a lower bound of the number of bits, and is used to evaluate the efficiency of bit encoding (later).

A bit is either 0 or 1. An **encoding** is an unambiguous mapping between bit strings and data. In other word, one can encode information as sequences of bits.

If each data appears with equal possibility, then **Fixed-length Encoding** is used; otherwise, **Variable length Encoding** is more preferred as it is more efficient (less entropy).

**Two's Complement Encoding** is a typical Fixed-length Encoding:

When information is transmit through noisy channels, a bit may be conveyed incidentically from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
There are **Signle-bit error** and **Multi-bit error**.

To detect signle-bit error, a redundent bit could be introduced to the original codeword. In particular, for a k-bit codeword, we can add a single parity bit to each codeword yielding an encoding with k+1-bit codewords. And the transmitter may, for example, always transmit a value for the parity bit that makes the total number of 1s in the codeword odd (odd parity); if the receiver gets a codeword with an even number of 1 bits, it will signal an error.

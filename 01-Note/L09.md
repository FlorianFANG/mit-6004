## L09 Instruction Set Architectures

We can design hardware to perform a particular computation problem by:

+ transform the problem to a FSM
+ draw the state transition diagram for the FSM
+ construct appropriate datapath by using register to store values and combinational logic (i.e. ALU) to implement the computating operations

Question: with fixed hardware circuit, how to solve many different problems? $\rightarrow$ **general purpose computer**.

Specific design for Factorial computation:

General design for not only Factorial but also other problems:

With a fixed digital circuit (like above 4-resigsters system), we can design different control FSM for different operation, which is called **programming** the system.

The most famous general purpose computer is von Neumann Model:

+ Datapath: registers that store the states & combinational logic (ALU), both of which realize sequential logic  
+ Control FSM: control the states transition
+ Main memory: hold the instructions (loaded to Control FSM) + data (loaded to Datapath)
+ I/O: exchange with external

General purpose registers: in datapath, can be read to supply source operands for ALU or written with ALU result  
Special purpose registers: called **Program Counter (PC)**, contains the address of the memory location holding the next instruction

**Instruction** specifies:

+ an operation / opcode
+ source operands
+ destination for the result

Instructions are excuted sequentially:  
1).PC fetch the next (new) instruction address (without specified, next address = current address + 4), and instruction loaded to control unit    
2).Decode the instruction  
3).Select source operands in registers  
4).Execute operation by ALU  
5).Write result in destination register  
6).Back to 1).

The collection of functional specifications of instructions corresponding to the datapath design is called **ISA**:

Three types of instruction:  

+ arithmetic and logical operation
+ load and store data between register and main memory  
+ branch: conditionally change PC (if..else..)

Two instruction formats (for 32-bit machine with 32 registers):

1). 6-bit OPCODE + 5-bit Ra, Rb, Rc + 11 unused bits  
2). 6-bit OPCODE + 5-bit Rc, Ra + 16-bit signed constant  
(Ra, Rb, Rc are register numbers)

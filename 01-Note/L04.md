## L04 Combinational Logic
Combinational function specification could be represented by:  
- Truth table or  
- Boolean algebra expression

Three basic boolean operations:  
- Inverter  
- And  
- Or

Extended operators:  
- NAND (Not AND)  
- NOR (Not OR)  
- XOR (True iff one is true and another is false)  
$\Rightarrow$ These are more suitable for our CMOS circuit because CMOS naturally likes inverting!!

One may simply the boolean expression / truth table to shorten the SUM-OF-PRODUCTS formula......But not always good to do so...

A safe simplification way is K-map:

In general a truth table has $k$ rows with $2^k$ values, which corresponds to different combinations of $k$ bits.  
A **multiplexer (MUX)** is designed to selects one of its $2^k$ value as the output.  
Actually, any truth table can be represented by an unique MUX.

The 3 inputs — A, B, and CIN — are used as the three select signals for the MUX. Think of the three inputs as forming a 3-bit binary number. For example, when they’re all 0, the MUX will select data input 0, and when they’re all 1, the MUX will select data input 7, and so on.  
If we change the truth table, we don’t have to redesign some complicated sum-of-products circuit, we simply have to change the constants on the data inputs.

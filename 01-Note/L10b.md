## L10b Models of Computation
What is the univeral computation model that solve all problems?

FSM could not solve all kinds of problems, for example the problem of parentheses checking, which depends on infinite states (inputs).

For this "infinity" problem, **Turing machine** is proposed consisting of:

+ FSM
+ Infinite digital tape recording states

Unproved theory: Any computational problem could be computed by Turing Machine

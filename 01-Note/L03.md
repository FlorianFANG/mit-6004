## L03 CMOS Technology
An ideal combinational device is such that: signal caused by very little power / voltage (zero dissipation), i.e. gain as large as possible:  
$\rightarrow$ push $V_{OH}$ and $V_{OL}$ outward towards power supply rails (higher $V_{OH}$ and smaller $V_{OL}$)  
$\rightarrow$ push $V_{IH}$ and $V_{IL}$ inward so that the white center area of VTC as small as possible

A **MOSFET** is such a ideal device, which is one of billions of parts in a modern integrated circuit (IC).

A MOSFET consists of 4 terminals:  
- Bulk (p-type semiconductor, lower plate of the Gate-Bulk capacitor)  
- Gate (conductor, upper plate of Gate-Bulk capacitor, to be charged)  
- Source (n-type semiconductor )  
- Grain (n-type semiconductor identical to Source)

It might have current flows from Drain to Source through a channel with length of $L$ and width of $W$.

Current flows from Drain to Source = switch closed / on  
No current = switch open / off

Current flows when
$$V_{GS} > V_{TH}$$
where $V_{GS} = V_{Gate} - V_{Source}$ and $V_{TH}$ is a particular threshold voltage.

Depletion region: formed when n-type and p-type materials come in physical contact, serves as an insulating layer between the substrate and source/drain.  
When $V_{TH}$ get larger than MOSFET’s threshold voltage, the electric field of Gate-Bulk is strong enough to pull the ubstrate electrons move towards the gate.  
When enough electrons accumulate, the type of the semiconductor changes from p-type to n-type and there’s now a channel of n-type material forming a conducting path between the source and drain terminals, called **inversion layer**.

Use of N-type MOSFET (NFET) and P-type MOSFECT (PFECT) forms the **complementary MOS (CMOS)** technology.  
And we can abstact the physical view to famous logical view (three-foot transitor).

Complementary refers to property that when one of the circuits is conducting, the other is not. When the pullup circuit is conducting and the pulldown circuit is not, the output node has a connection to $V_{DD}$ (power supply) and its output voltage will quickly rise to become a valid digital 1 output. Similarly, when the pulldown circuit is conducting and the pullup is not, the output node has a connection to GND and its output voltage will quickly fall to become a valid digital 0 output.

+ Propagation delay $t_{PD}$ is the delay from valid input to valid output, and for combinational circuit, it is the maximum cumulative delay over all paths from inputs to outputs.  
+ Contamination delay $t_{CD}$ is the delay from invalid input to invalid output, and for combinational circuit, it is the minimun cumulative delay over all paths from inputs to outputs.

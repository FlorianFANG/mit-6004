## L10a Assembly Language
![](https://computationstructures.org/lectures/assembly/slides/Slide03.png)

Higher level programming language is more abstracted from the bit-level representation of instruction and address  

**Assembly language** makes an assembly source file, which is a symbolic representation of stream of bytes, which could be converted by **assembler** to binary machine instruction to be loaded into memory.

Each statement of an assembly source file may contains:

+ Symbol: symbolic representation of a constant value
+ Label: symbol for address
+ Macro: instruction, sequence of bytes

Assembler makes two line-by-line passes through an assembly source file:

+ 1st pass: load the symbol table with "symbol - value" pair, where symbol include register number (e.g. r31) and user defined symbol (e.g. the N in formula N = 12)
+ 2nd pass: expand each line to binary instruction, e.g. expand ADD(r31, 1, 0) to 100000 11111 00001 00000 000000000000

## L02 Digital Abstraction
Except quantum physics, most of nature phenomena are continuous. To represent information of nature phenomenon, we need sequencial bits, which are discontinuous. So **digital abstraction** is introduced, to use continuous physical quantity (such as voltage) to represent the small, finite set of values, the bits.  

Using voltage digitally:  
- "0" if $V < V_{L}$  
- "1" if $V > V_{H}$  
- no info if $V_{L} < V < V_{H}$   

A device is **combinational device** if:  
- it has 1 or more digital inputs (voltage to bit convention)  
- it has 1 or more digital outputs
- it has a function specification mapping from input to output  
- it has a timing specification: propagation delay $t_{PD}$ that is the upper bound on time from when input reach to when output generated  
The above four conditions are said **static displine**

A devices system is combinational digital system if:  
- each device is combinational  
- each input is connected to 1 output or vast supply of 0s and 1s  
- no directed cycles

With strict $V_{L}$ and $V_{H}$, there is issue caused by noise:

A solution is noise margin:

For the white region in the center of the graph, it is in the forbidden zone. And the height ($V_{OH} - V_{OL}$) is larger than its width ($V_{IH} - V_{IL}$). Therefore, any curve passing through this region has a magnitude of slope greater than 1, in other word, the **Gain > 1** and the system is **nonlinear**.

In summary, to have tolerance noise:  
- add margins
- VTC with gain > 1 & nonlinearity

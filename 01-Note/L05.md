## L05 Sequential logic

A machine has **state** if it remember something about the history of input. Still, the device is governed by some functional specification, but the output would also depend on the state.

E.g a light bubble (device) has functional specification: push the button. The output (on / off) would depend on the current state (off / on).

The state is stored in **memory**.
Circuits that include combinational logic and memory components are called **sequential logic**.

We can use 2-to-1 MUX to store a bit (called **D Latch** or Latch):

G is the load signal (or gate or selector):  

+ when G is 0, Q = Q' holding the same value $\Rightarrow$ MUX in memory mode
+ when G is 1, Q = D  $\Rightarrow$ Q is written as D so in writing mode  

But the problem is how long G value is maintained? When to switch G from 1 to 0 or vice versa? In an other word, for the sequence of states, how to timing each state to go to the combinational logic?

Solution: Two gates **D Register** where the gate G is triggered by the rising edge of a periodic clock signal, so G is also called **clock**

If we have a single periodic clock signal is shared among all the clocked devices, we call single-clock synchronous discipline.
